# Price of Complexity
Code and sampled data related to the study of the price of complexity in financial markets. This analysis estimates systemic risk in networks of financial institutions and shows how the increasing complexcity of the network of contract among institutions comes with the price of increasing inaccuracy in the estimation of systemic risk.

The code in this repository allows to reproduce the figures reported in the manuscript and to explore several further aspects (e.g. diffferent parameters setting, underlying network of contracts, effect of the introduction of derivative contracts).
